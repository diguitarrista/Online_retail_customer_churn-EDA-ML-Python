# Online_retail_customer_churn-EDA-ML-Python
This project illustrates the power of machine learning in leveraging retail data to predict customer churn, offering valuable insights that can help in designing effective customer retention strategies.

# Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn in an online retail environment. Using a comprehensive dataset that includes customer demographics, transaction history, and engagement metrics, we aim to identify key factors that contribute to customer churn. Our goal is to leverage machine learning techniques to predict which customers are likely to churn, enabling targeted interventions to improve customer retention.

# Dataset Overview
The dataset includes various features such as customer age, gender, annual income, total spend, number of purchases, satisfaction score, and churn status. It provides a rich foundation for understanding customer behavior and predicting churn.

# Key Insights
- Initial exploratory data analysis revealed weak correlations between most variables and the target churn variable, indicating the complexity of predicting churn.
- Machine learning models, including RandomForestClassifier and BaggingClassifier, were applied with modest success in predicting churn.
- Further analysis highlighted the importance of feature engineering and the potential for using more advanced models or incorporating additional data sources to improve predictive accuracy.
